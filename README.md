## Core Concept

RAIN (Rhythm, Abstraction, Integration, and Noise) Theory proposes a new model for cognition that aims to solve the "Symbol Grounding Problem."

Instead of starting with abstract symbols (like traditional AI), this framework generates meaningful "Rhythm IDs" directly from sensory-motor experience. It posits that a rhythm's "closure" and "periodicity" are the foundation of semantic meaning. This bottom-up approach allows for the creation of grounded symbols that can then be utilized by powerful machine learning architectures like GNNs or Transformers.
